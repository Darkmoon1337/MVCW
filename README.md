The final version of carlogo classfication is called "Leon". the other file is history versions of code uploaded by mistake,just ignore them. 
Because of tons of parameter-tunning experimental, there is some errors of output(eg.dataset were already agumented and splited, but I ran them again)
You can reproducing all the experimental results which appered in the report by just modifying hyperparameter. if you dont know how, just contact me directly.
Due to the large number of tuning hyperparameter tuning experiments, and code block reuse (e.g., modifying the name of the model to run the code for ten evaluation metrics), the output may cause misunderstandings, 
but you can easily reproduce the results of the experiments BY modifying the hyperparameters and the model name!

Due to time constraints, there is no detailed markdown description of the code, which was not modified after the ddl because of the principle of fairness
If you have any confusions，please contact me on wechat!!! I will explain and reply clearly and immediately！！！！
